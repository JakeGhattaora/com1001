# Week 1: Getting Everything Setup

In this practical session, you'll be setting up an important means of
communication for your team in the form of the Slack app. 

**Note** depending on how you're viewing this file, the links in the
document may open in the _same_ window. So you don't lose your place in it,
right-click links and select "Open in New Tab" or similar.  

# 1. Setting up Slack in Your Team

Email is a slow communication medium, especially when your developing with
others in real-time, who, this semester, are unlikely to be in the same room.

Throughout the rest of the team project, you will be using "Slack". Slack
before, it's a group messaging app that was originally designed for developers
collaborating on different parts of a software application. Slack differs from
some other types of messaging app (e.g., WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger) in that
the conversation topics can be split into different "channels". Channels can be
hooked up to different services so that the team can be notified of events such
as pushes to the shared repository, or calendar events (e.g., important team
meetings).

**Since Slack was first released some similar apps like Discord have appeared.
We'll be using Slack however. It's important that you do, because you'll be
partly assessed on your usage of it.**

In the lab, we'll be using Slack in its web browser form. However, you're
strongly encouraged to download the application from the Slack website and
install it on your laptop, and download the app to your mobile device. This way
you can stay in touch with your team, wherever you are. Notifications will go
straight to your phone, keeping you up to date with the status of the project.
In case you're wondering, notifications can be "snoozed" when you're in other
teaching sessions or in bed at night... Slack is also sensitive to people
working in different timezones, and will politely tell you if another person is
outside of their working hours (you can set your timezone, if it is incorrect,
by editing your profile).

To do this you'll need to get it set up correctly, so read the next section
carefully, and follow all of its instructions. 

**Even if you already have a Facebook group, or some other way of keeping in
touch, this is the method you need to be using this semester, because this is
how we will be assessing you. Even if you're ahead of the game and you already
have a Slack team, you still need to create a new one as detailed below —
unfortunately here are too many teams for us to keep track of those that don't —
follow the naming scheme below.**

### The Steps You Need to Follow... 

To start using Slack, you'll need to set up a Slack "team", which is Slack's
term used to describe a particular group's set of private chat rooms: 

1. Nominate **one** person in your team to do the initial setting up of the
team. It needs to be one person, otherwise you'll potentially end up with
multiple Slack teams rather than just one. This person needs to perform the
following steps: 

    a. Go to https://slack.com/get-started.

    b. Enter your **University** email address in the text box, and click "Get
    Started". 

    c. Check your email for the code, and enter it on the web page, as
    instructed. 
    
    d. On the next page, click "Create a Workspace". 

    e. On the next page, entitled "What's the name of your company or team", set
    the team name to "ise23team**XX**" where **XX** is your two-digit team
    number (e.g., "ise23team01". Note the two digits — if your team number
    is between 1-9, you'll need to add a leading zero.

    f. _Skip_ the next page "Who else is on the team" —
    you'll invite your team members shortly. On the next page, entitled "What's
    your team working on right now", enter "Practical Sessions". (This will
    create your first channel.)

    g. On the next page, invite your teammates by entering their email addresses
    (don't click "Add teammates" yet) 

    h. Invite your **supervisor** to your team. This is important, otherwise we
    will not be able to assess you! Your supervisor's name (and their email
    address to invite them) can be found on the "[Teaching
    Team](https://vle.shef.ac.uk/webapps/blackboard/execute/content/blankPage?cmd=view&content_id=_6297724_1&course_id=_102787_1&mode=reset)" Blackboard page. They will also check in
    on your team from time to time, just to check everyone's engaged and you're
    all getting along...

    i. Invite your **demonstrator** to your team. Each team has their own
    demonstrator, who can also be located on the "[Teaching
    Team](https://vle.shef.ac.uk/webapps/blackboard/execute/content/blankPage?cmd=view&content_id=_6297724_1&course_id=_102787_1&mode=reset)" Blackboard page. Scroll down the page to
    "Undergraduate Practical Session (Computer Lab) Demonstrators" and find your
    demonstrator and their email address. If, during the week, you need some
    help, you can message your demonstrator and they will endeavour to help at
    the earliest convenient opportunity.

    j. Now you can click "Add teammates".

2. If you need help with any of the above steps, identify and ask your
demonstrator in the lab class. They should be your first port of call in case of
problems. You can also try the [discussion board](https://vle.shef.ac.uk/webapps/discussionboard/do/conference?toggle_mode=read&action=list_forums&course_id=_102787_1&nav=discussion_board_entry&mode=view)
on the COM1001 Blackboard page.

3. Your team's messaging service will now be available at
   https://ise23teamXX.slack.com. 

4. Each team member should respond to their invitation to join the team, via
their email. 

5. Everyone in the team should sign into your team and edit their profile and
enter their full name, so that it is displayed in the left-hand pane of the
Slack window. **NB: Use your proper name** — don't use nicknames, usernames for
other services or anything else that could prevent the teaching team identifying
who you are on Slack. Remember, Slack usage is one way in which your team will
be assessed.


# 2. Getting the Most out of Slack

Now your team is set up on Slack, start playing around with its features. Try
setting up a few "channels". You could have ones for the development of
different features in your application, for example, or channels for different
activities. You can do this by clicking "Add Channels" in the lefthand sidebar.

You can alert certain people to a message by including their username  prefixing
with the `@` symbol (a bit like Twitter, for example `@andrewstratton Have you
pushed the code yet?`. Everyone in a channel can be alerted with `@channel`
(e.g, `@channel Hi everyone!`).

If you set up channels, ensure that your supervisor has been added to them,
otherwise your chats will be invisible to them, defeating the point of including
them in your Slack team in the first place. (When it comes to marking, we won't
be searching for channels you may or may not have created that you didn't add us
to, so you won't get any marks that might have been assigned.)


# 3. Integration with Git

One very useful feature is the ability to be notified by your Git repository of
when somebody pushes to it.

Again, nominate one individual to do the following steps. Go to
https://my.slack.com/services/new/incoming-webhook. Select a channel for the notifications to be sent
to. (I'd advise you create one called "Git", or some such, and have all of
the updates sent there, so that they don't clutter any actual conversations
you have as team members.) Click the "Add Incoming WebHooks integration"
button. On the following page, under "Setup Instructions", there is an item
labelled "Webhook URL". Copy the entire URL, and then send it as the body
of an email to `support@shefcompsci.org.uk` with the subject "COM1001 team XX
webhook". Then wait for us to set it up for you.


# 4. Customizing Slack and Adding Useful Features

If you click the arrow down icon on your team name in the Slack window, and
go to "Settings & administration", then "Manage apps", then "Browse" in the
top right corner; you can find lots of apps to plug into Slack to make it
more useful to your team. Some examples include the GSuite apps, which can
be used to integrate Google apps, including Google Calendar, which will
alert you to events in your calendar. For example, you could set up a
Google Calendar for your team to schedule your team's activities (e.g.,
meetings), and be automatically notified of impending events via Slack.

If you go back and click the down arrow again, and this time select
"Customize ..." under "Settings & administration", you can customize other
aspects of Slack — like creating your own emojis, change loading messages
etc.

# 5. And Finally, If You've Haven't Already ....

If there's no time left in the session, and if you
haven't done it already — your homework is to get your personal Codio project (box) set up and
install the COM1001 repository on it, and then your team's repository as per the
instructions on the "[Getting Started](https://vle.shef.ac.uk/webapps/blackboard/execute/content/blankPage?cmd=view&content_id=_6297831_1&course_id=_102787_1&mode=reset)" page on
Blackboard.
